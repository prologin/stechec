** @brief Manage SDL Window.

** Manage creation of a SDL Window and collect its events into Input class.
**
** Here is a simple example of how to use it:
** @code
** int run_win(xml::XMLConfig* xml)
** {
**   SDLWindow win(xml);
**   win.init();
**   VirtualSurface& screen = win.getScreen();
**   // Do something with screen, like adding sprites.
**   while (true) {
**     Input& inp = win.getInput();
**     // Do something, this is your main loop!
**     // You can fetch mouse pos/keyboard state into 'inp'.
**     if (win.processOneFrame())
**       break;
**   }
** }
