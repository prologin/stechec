    <background>Long ago, driven by a desire for adventure, the Valkyries of the Norse settlement in Lustria sailed away from their men-folk and founded a colony deep within the estuary of the river Amaxon.

    <background>Chaos teams are not noted for the subtlety or originality of their game play. A simple drive up the centre of the pitch, maiming and injuring as many opposing players as possible, is about the limit of their game plan. They rarely, if ever, worry about such minor considerations like picking up the ball and scoring touchdowns not while there are any players left alive on the opposing team, anyway.</background>

    <background>Chaos Dwarfs are the twisted descendants of Dwarf explorers who have been terribly affected by the forces of Chaos, turning them into evil, self-centred creatures. In one way, however, they haven't changed at all, they still love playing Blood Bowl! Chaos Dwarfs are not very numerous and make great use of sneaky Hobgoblin slaves to perform all kinds of tasks, including playing on their Blood Bowl teams.</background>

    <background>Evil beyond belief, skilled without doubt, the Dark Elves take to the pitch to show the world their superiority. Dark Elf teams prefer a malevolent and spiteful running game over the passing of their goodly cousins. Backed up by the ruthless Witch Elves and dangerous assassins, a Dark Elf team has all the tools to power through rather than around any opposition line.</background>

    <background>Dwarfs seem to be ideal Blood Bowl players, being compact, tough, well-armoured and having a stubborn knack of refusing to die! Most successful Dwarf teams work to the principle that if they can take out all the other team's potential scorers, and wear down the rest, then there won't be anybody left to stop them scoring the winning touchdowns!</background>

    <background>When the NAF collapsed, many Elven teams were left penniless. Those teams that have survived the fallout are not as rich as the High Elf teams nor as well equipped, but they sure know how to play the game. Sporting facemasks and mohawks, they take to the pitch to relive the glory days they once played in.</background>

    </positions>
    <background>A Goblin team's game plan owes much more to hope than potential. Goblins can make quite good catchers because they are small and agile, but the art of throwing is sadly lost to them, while the chances of their blocking anything larger than a Halfling are remote to say the least. Still, this never seems to bother Goblin players, and occasionally the use of a particularly devious secret weapon will even allow a Goblin team to win a match.</background>

    </positions>
    <background>The technical deficiency of Halfling teams is legendary. They're too short to throw or catch, they run at half pace, and the whole team can spend all afternoon trying to block an Ogre without any chance of success. Most Halfling coaches try to make up for quality with quantity. After all, if you can get half a dozen players in the opposing team's End Zone and, by some miracle, manage to end up with the ball, then there is a small chance that one or two of them wonï¿½t be jelly by the time you throw the thing.</background>

    <background>Over 8,000 years ago, the Khemri played the first games of Blood Bowl against the Slann. But, as the Kingdom died off, so did the game until its rediscovery.

    <background>The Mage-Priests foretold the game of Blood Bowl thousands of years before it was discovered by the Dwarf Roze-El. So it is no surprise that the Lizardmen play Blood Bowl.

    <background>Nurgle teams are a form of Chaos team whose players worship the god Nurgle. Nurgle is the Chaos god of corruption and disease, and he rewards his players by granting them a rather unpleasant disease known as Nurgle's Rot. The fact that Nurgle teams smell awful is assumed rather than proven. True, they are all made up of semi decomposed flesh surrounded by swarms of flies, but by the time anyone gets close enough to get a really accurate whiff, he has inevitably caught one of Nurgle's nasty diseases, and he usually dies before he can suggest a new personal hygiene regime.</background>

However, as any right-minded person will tell you, having more than one Ogre in the same place at the same time is a disaster in the making. The key to an Ogre team is the Snotlings. If they are close enough to jab an Ogre in the leg to remind him that they are playing in a match then you may have the makings of a team.</background>

    <background>For Wood Elves the Long pass is everything, even more so than their High Elf cousins, and all of their effort goes into being an expert at throwing or receiving. No Wood Elf worth his salt is going to be weighed down by extra Armour and be forced to lurk about, attempting to knock opposing players over. Instead they rely on their natural athletic ability to keep them out of trouble, which is normally enough ' it takes a very agile or lucky opponent to lay a hand on a Wood Elf!</background>
